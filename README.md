📊 PhonePe Pulse Data Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

This project is a complete data analysis and visualization of PhonePe digital transactions across India.
Using the official PhonePe Pulse dataset, I explored transaction trends, user growth patterns, and geographical insights, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to represent key metrics clearly.

🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing digital payment behaviour using PhonePe’s aggregated datasets.
It includes: Transaction analysis by state, year, quarter, and type User analysis including registered users & active users Mapping transactions on the India geographic map Identifying top-performing states based on volume & value Comparison of growth trends over time

🗂 Dataset Used
I worked with the following datasets:
aggregated_transactions – amount, transaction count, type
aggregated_user – user counts, device brands
map_transactions – state-wise geo data

top_user – top user districts

All datasets were cleaned and transformed before visualization.
